        <p class="first"> "The Handmade Web" <br>
        this article brought to mind the current fear of many traditional artists, the loss of handmade art.<br>
        a discussion particularly present in the context of AI generated art, <br>
        i particularly agree with Carpenter in the significance of retaliating against the highly commercialized web with "the handmade web"<br>
        i like that the handmade web includes continuous interaction with its form and code. </p>

        <p class="second">"My Website is a Shifting House"<br>
        i love how Schulst articulates the potential of a website, and the clarification of its form:<br>
        "a website creator becomes both author and architect simultaneously. there are endless possibilities as to what a website could be."<br>
        i also loved how she discussed the different potential functions of a website (room, shelf, plant, garden, puddle, rock).  <br>
        there's so much creative freedom in making and maintaining a website!</p>

        <p class="third">"A Rant About Technology"<br>
        i like this quote, "technology is the active human interface with the material world."<br>
        it is true that many useful and valuable technologies are overlooked due to their apparent simplicity or primitive nature.<br>
        the wheel was not particularly extravagant in presentation, but was a monumental achievement for humanity.<br>
        technology doesn't always come in the form of computers and code.</p>
