        <h2> 01  |  good design is innovative. </h2>
        <h3> the possibilities for innovation are not, by any means, exhausted. <br>
        </br> technological development is always offering new opportunities for innovative design. <br>
        </br> but innovative design always develops in tandem with innovative technology, and can never be an end in itself.</h3>

        <h2> 02  |  good design makes a product useful. </h2>
        <h3>  a product is bought to be used. <br>
        </br> it has to satisfy certain criteria, not only functional, but also psychological and aesthetic. <br>
        </br> good design emphasizes the usefulness of a product whilst disregarding anything that could possibly detract from it.</h3>

        <h2> 03  |  good design is aesthetic. </h2>
        <h3> the aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its usefulness because products we use every day affect our person and our well-being. <br>  
        </br> but only well-executed objects can be beautiful.</h3>

        <h2> 04  |  good design makes a product understandable.</h2>
        <h3> it clarifies the product's structure. better still, it can make the product talk. at best, it is self-explanatory.</h3>

        <h2> 05  |  good design is unobtrusive.</h2>
        <h3> products fulfilling a purpose are like tools. <br>
        </br> they are neither decorative objects nor works of art. <br>
        </br> their design should therefore be both neutral and restrained, to leave room for the user's self-expression.</h3>

        <h2> 06  |  good design is honest. </h2>
        <h3> it does not make a product more innovative, powerful or valuable than it really is. <br>
        </br> it does not attempt to manipulate the consumer with promises that cannot be kept.</h3>

        <h2> 07  |  good design is long-lasting. </h2>
        <h3> it avoids being fashionable and therefore never appears antiquated. <br>
        </br> unlike fashionable design, it lasts many years - even in today's throwaway society.</h3>

        <h2> 08  |  good design is thorough down to the last detail. </h2>
        <h3> nothing must be arbitrary or left to chance. <br>
        </br> care and accuracy in the design process show respect towards the user.</h3>

        <h2> 09  |  good design is environmentally-friendly. </h2>
        <h3> design makes an important contribution to the preservation of the environment. <br>
        </br> it conserves resources and minimizes physical and visual pollution throughout the lifecycle of the product.</h3>

        <h2> 10  |  good design is as little design as possible. </h2>
        <h3> less, but better - because it concentrates on the essential aspects, and the products are not burdened with non-essentials.</h3>
