                <h2> What is Microsoft Teams?</h2>
                <h3> Teams functions as a messaging app, frequently used in corporate settings for communication.
                    It's mainly marketed as a communication platform for the workplace, therefore the target audience is mainly companies.  
                    </h3>

                <h2> Content </h2>
                <h3> The text is easily readable, using a clear sans serif font. <br> 
                    <br> 
                    The content is everything necessary to effective communication in the context of the workplace, and uses a format that is typically universal to most communication platforms so that users are easily able to figure out the features. <br>
                    <br>
                    There are limited media/images, which is fine for this app. Users are able to post images in channels, and also send images in the chat. 
                    </h3>

    <h2> Visual Elements/UI </h2>
    <p> The app does not necessarily maintain visual hierarchy, as the experience itself is not so much chronological or ordered as it is based on the needs and tasks of the user. <br>
        <br>  
        Across the app, fonts, colors, and layouts remain consistent. A navigation bar lives on the left side of the interface for constant navigation availability, the colors remain to be purple. black and white, and the font doesn't change. <br> 
        <br> 
        Interestingly, because this app is mainly used for communication, the visual elements are not exactly stimulating. If anything, they are clean and minimal so as to not confuse users and create a clean and organized look for the app. <br> 
        <br> 
        The app works well on desktop, but is slightly limited on mobile due to the loss of screen space. </p>

<h2>Interactivity/UX</h2>
<div class="reference">

</div>
<h3>
    <br> Interestingly, there is no set homepage. The different features of the app exist equally, and so the default tab when the user opens the app is the chat tab. <br> <br> 
    As mentioned previously, navigation is pretty simple with the use of the nav bar, which includes icons and features universal to most communication platforms, and therefore intuitive. <br> <br> 
    The "teams" tab on the app allows for different teams to be created with specific users, and within those teams, different channels can be created, whether for social events or announcements. <br>

    <h2> Recommendations </h2>
    <h3> Although a navigation bar is present, perhaps a home page would be useful for users. There is no chronologically implied use of the app, but a homepage may help users to navigate the app in a way that is organized and clear. <br> <br> 
        Visually, the existing interface is fine. It communicates its content clearly and presents it pleasantly. <br> <br> 
        Interestingly enough, many user complaints about Microsoft Teams lies in the functions of the features. Sometimes the notifications can get glitchy, or some other feature function. <br> <br>
