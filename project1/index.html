                "beautifully written, engaging coming of age story about a vivacious orphan girl as she 
                comes into her own makes new friends and wins the hearts of all she comes across."</p>

                "you can't help but fall in love with Anne. she is the friend you have always longed for, the daughter that will bring that much-needed light in your life,
                that student that any teacher would be proud to instruct. she is funny, imaginative, bright, and a regular chatterbox."</p> 

                <p class="third">reader ieynes says...<br>
                "Anne of Green Gables is charming, hilarious, heart-warming, and gut-wrenching at the same time. I didn't expect to laugh out loud (for real, no hyperbole!) every other page. Every single joke landed with me. Montgomery's witty writing style, the banter, Anne's hilarious monologues and Marilla's unsympathetic responses, the little adventures and mishaps that Anne gets herself into on a daily basis - it's all so wonderful."
