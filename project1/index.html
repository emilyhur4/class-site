                <p class="first"> 
                    This heartwarming story has beckoned generations of readers into the special world of Green Gables, an old-fashioned farm outside a town called Avonlea. 
                    Anne Shirley, an eleven-year-old orphan, has arrived in this verdant corner of Prince Edward Island only to discover that the Cuthberts - elderly Matthew and his stern sister, Marilla - want to adopt a boy, not a feisty redheaded girl. 
                    But before they can send her back, Anne - who simply must have more scope for her imagination and a real home - wins them over completely. 
                    A much-loved classic that explores all the vulnerability, expectations, and dreams of a child growing up, Anne of Green Gables is also a wonderful portrait of a time, a place, a family... and, most of all, love.</p>

                    <br>
                "Anne of Green Gables is charming, hilarious, heart-warming, and gut-wrenching at the same time. I didn't expect to laugh out loud (for real, no hyperbole!) every other page. Every single joke landed with me. Montgomery's witty writing style, the banter, Anne's hilarious monologues and Marilla's unsympathetic responses, the little adventures and mishaps that Anne gets herself into on a daily basis - it's all so wonderful."

                <p class="excerpt1"> Anne went to the little Avonlea graveyard the next evening to put fresh flowers on Matthew's grave and water the Scotch rosebush. 
                    She lingered there until dusk, liking the peace and calm of the little place, with its poplars whose rustle was like low, friendly speech, and its whispering grasses growing at will among the graves. 
                    When she finally left it and walked down the long hill that sloped to the Lake of Shining Waters it was past sunset and all Avonlea lay before her in a dreamlike afterlight - "a haunt of ancient peace."
                    There was a freshness in the air as of a wind that had blown over honey-sweet fields of clover. Home lights twinkled out here and there among the homestead trees. 
                    Beyond lay the sea, misty and purple, with its haunting, unceasing murmur. The west was a glory of soft mingled hues, and the pond reflected them all in still softer shadings. 
                    The beauty of it all thrilled Anne's heart, and she gratefully opened the gates of her soul to it. <br>
                    <br>
                    <i>"Dear old world," she murmured, "you are very lovely, and I am glad to be alive in you."</i>
