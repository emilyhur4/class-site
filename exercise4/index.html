                <h2>A Layer Cake</h2><br>
                <h4> Stacking gives greater consistency in design in the face of varying screen sizes. This is an accurate, yet sneaky consistency across countless websites. Why haven't I noticed it before? </h4> <br> <br>

                <h2> The Pursuit of Cool</h2><br>
                <h4> Yeah, cool websites are nice, but what is the purpose of the pursuit of cool? According to Chimero, Apple for example, got lost in the pursuit of cool for their own website. It's cool, but overwhelming: it goes against the flow of websites, or <i>the grain of the web.</i> </h4> <br> <br>
                <h2> Best Practices?</h2><br>
                <h4> Shared solutions due to shared materials, says Chimero. Interesting that consistency in design solutions isn't a bad thing, which is what I thought. Perhaps I believed that creativity was compromised when seeing signs of consistency across works. But in fact, it's a pattern that should be expected.</h4> <br> <br>
                <h2>So, what is web design then?</h2><br>
                <h4>"an edgeless surface of unknown proportions comprised of small, individual, and variable elements from multiple vantages assembled into a readable whole that documents a moment." Pretty awesome!</h4> <br> <br>

                <h4>Chimero notes that the web's structure is made so that it can branch out forever. </h4>
                <br> <br>
                <h4>Individual pages linked together - they can go on forever!</h4><br><br>
                <h4>Screens offer an endless canvas to scroll through.</h4><br><br>
                <h4>Blurred lines between disciplines!</h4><br><br> 
                <h4><i>This part is exciting:</i> the edgelessness of the web tears down the constructed edges in the company, and leaves more space for collaboration!</h4><br><br>
